title: Custom Localizer
---

You can create your own localizer by extending the `Localizer` class. 
This allows you to implement custom localization logic or different localization hardware that is not supported by the existing localizers.

### Hardware
All hardware should remain in the Localizer class. 
This ensures that the localizer can access the necessary hardware components directly.
For example, if you are using a custom sensor, you would initialize it in the constructor of your localizer class.

### Constants
It is suggested that you create a Constants class for your localizer.
This allows for easy configuration and modification of the localizer's parameters without changing the Localizer itself, although not required.
So, for a `CustomLocalizer`, you would create a `CustomLocalizerConstants` class.
In the `Constants` file, you would then create a `CustomLocalizerConstants` object and pass it to your localizer through the constructor.
