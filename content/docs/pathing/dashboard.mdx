description: Panels or the FTC Dashboard
---

It is best to use Pedro Pathing with a dashboard to assist in tuning and
viewing paths live. You may use either [Panels](https://panels.bylazar.com)
or the [FTC Dashboard](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard). The
quickstart comes with Panels installed by default. If you are not using the
quickstart or would like to use FTC Dashboard instead, follow the
installation instructions on the dashboard of your choice.

## Panels

Panels is an intuitive, real-time dashboard for FTC. It supports live tuning
of constants, visualizing the robot on the field, and logging & graphing the
robot's state live. It is fully supported by Pedro Pathing.

## FTC Dashboard

The FTC Dashboard is a web app for monitoring FTC robots during operation.
Like Panels, it supports visualizing the robot on the field and logging &
graphing the robot's state live. However, because of the complexity of Pedro
Pathing's constants, it does not support live tuning of Pedro Pathing.
