There are two ways to install Pedro Pathing.

## Using the Quickstart

The quickstart is the easiest way to install Pedro Pathing.

1. In Android Studio, go to `Main Menu -> File -> New -> Project from
Version Control`. For the URL, enter
`https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart.git`.
2. **OR** run `git clone https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart.git`.
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed first.

## Manually

In your `build.dependencies.gradle`, add the following to the `repositories
{ }` block:

```groovy
maven { url = 'https://maven.pedropathing.com' }
```

Then, add the following to the `dependencies { }` block:

<PedroImplementation/>

```groovy
implementation 'com.pedropathing:telemetry:0.0.6'
implementation 'com.pedropathing.panels:core:0.0.23'
implementation 'com.pedropathing.panels:telemetry:0.0.9'
implementation 'com.pedropathing.panels:field:0.0.13'
implementation 'com.pedropathing.panels:configurables:0.0.15'
implementation 'com.pedropathing.panels:utils:0.0.11'
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  The Pedro panels imports are not required, you can choose to use FTControl Panels if you wish, the choice is yours.
  However, you will have to add another maven repository for FTControl Panels. You *will* have to modify import usages in the Drawing and Tuning classes.
</Callout>

Next, navigate to `File -> Project Structure -> Modules`. 
There, click on each module (`FtcRobotController` and `Teamcode`) and set their `Compile SDK Version` to 34.  
Then, click `Apply` and `Ok` to exit. 

Optionally, perform a Gradle Sync (the Elephant with the down arrow at the top right of your Android Studio Top Toolbar) to verify all dependencies are downloaded.  
There may also be a blue banner with a `Sync Now` button that you may press instead.

Lastly, copy the files from the [`pedroPathing` package in the quickstart](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart/tree/dev/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/pedroPathing)
into your code.
