## Forward Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Forward Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving forward at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches forward, but this can be 
changed by navigating to the `ForwardVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start Forward Velocity Tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the velocity to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.xMovement(velocity)
```

## Lateral Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Lateral Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving sideways at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches to the left, but this can be 
changed by navigating to the `LateralVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start Lateral Velocity Tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the velocity to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.yMovement(velocity)
```

## Forward Zero Power Acceleration

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  Measures how your robot decelerates when moving forward and power is cut from the drivetrain. 
  This value is critical for improving motion accuracy in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough space to accelerate 30 in/s forward (roughly 1 tile). You can adjust this constraint
by navigating to `ForwardZeroPowerAccelerationTuner` in `Tuning.java`. Typically values closer to your 
max forward velocity yield better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start Forward
Zero Power Acceleration Tuner. The robot will speed up until it reaches the commanded velocity, then cut power and measure the deceleration rate.

Once the robot stops moving, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Forward Zero Power Acceleration (Deceleration): The deceleration rate of the robot; this is what we want

Add the above number to `FollowerConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.forwardZeroPowerAcceleration(deceleration)
```

## Lateral Zero Power Acceleration

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  Measures how your robot decelerates when moving lateral and power is cut from the drivetrain. 
  This value is critical for improving motion accuracy in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough space to accelerate 30 in/s to the left (roughly 1 tile). You can adjust this constraint
by navigating to `LateralZeroPowerAccelerationTuner` in `Tuning.java`. Typically values closer to your 
max lateral velocity yield better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start `Lateral 
Zero Power Acceleration Tuner`. The robot will speed up until it reaches the commanded velocity, then cut power and measure the deceleration rate.

Once the robot stops moving, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Lateral Zero Power Acceleration (Deceleration): The deceleration rate of the robot; this is what we want

Add the above number to `FollowerConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.lateralZeroPowerAcceleration(deceleration)
```

Congratulations, you've completed all of the automatic tuners!
