title: Centripetal
description: Tuning the centripetal scaling
---

### Purpose

The centripetal force correction enables the robot to accurately follow curved paths.

### Setup 

1. Open Panels. If you haven't used Panels before, you can read the documentation on [Panels Configurables](https://panels.bylazar.com/docs/com.bylazar.configurables/).
2. On your Driver Hub or Driver Station, select the `Tuning` Opmode, navigate to `Manual` and then choose `CentripetalTuner`. 
3. Ensure that the timer for autonomous OpModes is **disabled.** Otherwise, the OpMode will automatically stop after 30 seconds.
4. Run the run the `CentripetalTuner` autonomous OpMode.

**WARNING: Immediately after running the `Centripetal Tuner` Opmode, the robot will move forward and left 20 inches in a curved path. Make sure you have enough space before running this opmode.**
You can adjust the distance the robot drives back and forth through Panels. 

## Tuning Process
Follow this video to help you tune the centripetal scalar:

Observe the robotâ€™s path:

- If the robot corrects towards the inside of the curve, decrease `centripetalScaling`.
- If the robot corrects towards the outside of the curve, increase `centripetalScaling`.
Adjust the value of `centripetalScaling` within the `Tuning`-> `Follower` -> `Constants` section in Panels.

### Update Tuned values Into Your Code
1. Once you are satisfied with your `centripetalScaling`, head over to the `Constants` file. 
2. Navigate to the line `.centripetalScaling(0.005)` under `followerConstants`. If you don't have this line, feel free to add it yourself. 
3. Update the parameters in `.centripetalScaling(0.005)` with the `centripetalScaling` value you tuned. 

## Troubleshooting
