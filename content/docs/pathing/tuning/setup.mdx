## Setting your robot's mass

Your robot's mass is used to compensate for centripetal force. To set the
mass, simply add `.mass` in `FollowerConstants`. Note that the mass **must
be in kilograms**.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static FollowerConstants followerConstants = new FollowerConstants()
        .mass(5);
```

<Callout title="Tip" type="info">
  If you don't have a large enough scale to weigh your robot, you can stand on
  the scale while holding your robot and then subtract your own weight.
</Callout>

## Adding drivetrain constants

Next, we will add our drivetrain constants. These include motor names, motor
directions, and the max power. The max power must be a number from 0 to 1.

### Mecanum

If you have a mecanum drivetrain, add the following to your `Constants` class.

```java title="Constants.java"
public static MecanumConstants driveConstants = new MecanumConstants()
        .maxPower(1)
        .rightFrontMotorName("rf")
        .rightRearMotorName("rr")
        .leftRearMotorName("lr")
        .leftFrontMotorName("lf")
        .leftFrontMotorDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE)
        .leftRearMotorDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE)
        .rightFrontMotorDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARD)
        .rightRearMotorDirection(DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARD)
```

<Callout title="Important" type="warning">
  Make sure that your motor names and directions are correct. It's likely
  that you will have to reverse one side!
</Callout>

Then, add the mecanum drivetrain to the follower builder in `createFollower`:

```java title="Constants.java"
public static Follower createFollower(HardwareMap hardwareMap) {
        return new FollowerBuilder(followerConstants, hardwareMap)
                .pathConstraints(pathConstraints)
                .mecanumDrivetrain(driveConstants)
                .build();
```
