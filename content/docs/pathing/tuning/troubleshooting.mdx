*TODO*

Cover:
- Common problems with tuning, and how to fix them
- Where to get help if you're still having trouble

Use the following format:

<Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Bad Localization">
        **If you're using a two wheel localizer:**
        
        Check whether: 
        - Your encoder's `HardwareMapName` is incorrect or if the parallel & perpendicular odometry pods' names are swapped.
        - Your encoders directions are reversed.
        - Your IMU orientations (`LogoFacingDirection`, `UsbFacingDirection`) are incorrect.
        - Your odometry pod offests are inaccurate

        Try also running `Forward Tuner` and `Lateral Tuner` more times to get more accurate results for `forwardTicksToInches` and `strafeTicksToInches`.
        
        **If you're using a three wheel localizer:**
        
        Check whether: 
        - Your encoder's `HardwareMapName` is incorrect or if a parallel & perpendicular odometry pods' names are swapped (will result in robot rotating and translating if swapped).
        - Your encoders directions are reversed.
        - Your IMU orientations (`LogoFacingDirection`, `UsbFacingDirection`) are incorrect.
        - Your odometry pod offests are inaccurate
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot drifts turning DriveTuner">
        **If you're using a drive encoders, two wheel, three wheel, or OTOS,** a small amount of drift will happen over time, as these localizer's aren't perfect. 
        However, the tolerence should remain manageable for the entire 30 second autonomous period.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="PID not PIDing">
        skill issue
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot's movements are too jittery">
        Check your `brakingStrength` in `PathConstraints` and try decreasing it slightyly. This will make the braking smoother and reduce the
        oscillations.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot never stops while running a Tuning program or moves in the wrong direction">
        **Check if:** 
        - Your localization is inaccurate. Run `LocalizationTest` and check: 
            - when you move the robot forward, does the x-value increase?
            - when you move the robot to the left, does the y-value increase?
            - is the reported heading accurate?
        If not, head over back to the localization section and double check your steps. Ensure that your localization is fully accurate before tuning your PIDFs and running automatic tuners. 
        - Your motor directions are reversed. 
        - Your motor configurations are incorrect.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot never moves during TranslationalTuner or HeadingTuner">
        **If you are tuning for Translational or Heading PIDF, it is intentional that the robot doesn't initially move.**
        However, if you push/turn the robot and it still doesn't move, check whether your P value in the PIDF is too low. Increasing it may give more power for your robot to correct back to its original position. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Cannot see the followerConstants through Panels">
        Double check that you have the `@Configurable` annotation in your `Constants` class. 
    </Accordion>
