## 1. Convert Constants
    ### a. Open our [Constants Migrator](https://pedro-pathing.github.io/ConstantsConverter/) in your browser of choice (This will not work well on mobile devices).
    ### b. Input your existing FConstants and LConstants classes directly into the Converter.
    ### c. Create a Constants class and paste the output (right side) of the converter into that class.
