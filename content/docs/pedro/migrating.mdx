### Convert Constants
    1. Open our [Constants Migrator](https://pedro-pathing.github.io/ConstantsConverter/) in your browser of choice (This will not work well on mobile devices).
    2. Input your existing FConstants and LConstants classes directly into the Converter.
    3. Create a Constants class and paste the output (right side) of the converter into that class.

### Copy Tuning Class 
Copy the Tuning class from the [Quickstart](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/Quickstart/blob/dev/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/pedroPathing/Tuning.java) and place it in your repository

This TeleOp contains all of the Tuners/Tests needed to tune Pedro and verify that it is correctly working.

To use it:

        a. Init the OpMode  

        b. Use the controller to navigate through the Folders  

        c. Select an Test/Tuner to run with Right Trigger  

        d. Instructions will be displayed via Telemetry  

        e. Press "Play" to start the Test/Tuner!  

### Change Follower Constructors
Based on the static `createFollower` method, we can replace our previous constructors for the Follower.

Instead of `follower = new Follower(hardwareMap, FConstants.class, LConstants.class);`, we can now use `follower = Constants.createFollower(hardwareMap);`.  
  
This creates an instance of the Follower based on the provided constants, meaning we can have multiple different sets of Constants for seperate opmodes.
