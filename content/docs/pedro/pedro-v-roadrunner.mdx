title: PedroPathing vs Roadrunner
description: Pros vs. Cons of both PedroPathing and Roadrunner 1.0
---

For FTC when it comes to pathfinding, there are two main solutions, **Roadrunner** and **PedroPathing**.
Although both are designed to achieve the same task, each have their own benefits and tradeoffs. The table
below comapres the different features

| Feature | **Road Runner** | **PedroPathing** |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Control Model | Feedforward + Feedback (PID) | Mostly feedback (PID) |
| Path Type | Parametric Splines | Beizer Curves |
| Autonomous Logic | Trajectory-centric | Condition-based waypoint state flow |
| API Complexity | Low, more intuitive | Medium |
| Tuning Difficulty | Easy (constraints + PID + feedforward) | Medium (mostly PID only) |
| Best For | Accuracy and predicability | Localization and speed |
| Odometry | Built-in (2/3 wheel localizer) | Optional, but more localization choices |
| Reactive Transitions | Not built-in | Built-in via conditions |
| Command Integration | External (FTCLib, SolversLib, NextFTC) | Built-in (Actions) |
