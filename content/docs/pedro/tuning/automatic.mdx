## Forward Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Forward Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving forward at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches, but this can be 
change by navigating to the `ForwardVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the forward velocity tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.xMovement(velocity)
```

## Lateral Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Lateral Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving sideways at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches, but this can be 
change by navigating to the `LateralVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the lateral velocity tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.yMovement(velocity)
```

## Forward Zero Power Acceleration

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  Measures how your robot decelerates when moving forward and power is cut from the drivetrain. 
  This value is critical for improving motion accuracy in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough to accelerate 30 in/s forward. You can adjust the velocity
by navigating to `ForwardZeroPowerAccelerationTuner` in `Tuning.java`. Typically values closer to your 
max velocity yield better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the forward 
zero power acceleration test. The robot will speed up rapidly until it reaches the inputted velocity, then
abruptly cut power and measure the deacceleration rate.

Once the robot stops moving, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Forward Zero Power Acceleration: The deacceleration rate of the robot; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `FollowerConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.forwardZeroPowerAcceleration(deacceleration)
```

## Lateral Zero Power Acceleration

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  Measures how your robot decelerates when moving lateral and power is cut from the drivetrain. 
  This value is critical for improving motion accuracy in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough to accelerate 30 in/s to the left. You can adjust the velocity
by navigating to `LateralZeroPowerAccelerationTuner` in `Tuning.java`. Typically values closer to your 
max velocity yield better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the lateral 
zero power acceleration test. The robot will speed up rapidly until it reaches the inputted velocity, then
abruptly cut power and measure the deacceleration rate.

Once the robot stops moving, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Lateral Zero Power Acceleration: The deacceleration rate of the robot; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `FollowerConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.lateralZeroPowerAcceleration(deacceleration)
```

Congratulations, you've completed all of the automatic tuners!
