## Forward Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Forward Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving forward at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches, but this can be 
change by navigating to the `ForwardVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the forward velocity tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.xMovement(velocity)
```

## Lateral Velocity Tuner

<Callout title="Purpose" type="info">
  The Lateral Velocity Tuner determines the velocity of your robot when moving sideways at full power. 
  This value is used for accurate path-following calculations in Pedro Pathing.
</Callout>

First, make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches, but this can be 
change by navigating to the `LateralVelocityTuner` class in `Tuning.java`. Typically larger numbers yield
better results. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start the lateral velocity tuner. The 
robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power. It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance,
then it will abruptly stop.

Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:

- Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

Add the multiplier to `MecanumConstants` by adding or editing the following.

```java title="Constants.java"
.yMovement(velocity)
```
