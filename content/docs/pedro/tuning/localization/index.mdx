There are many localizers for you to choose from. If you don't have any, you
can use your drive motor encoders.

All localizers except for the OTOS localizer
use a pose exponential method of localization, a way of turning movements
from the robot's coordinate frame to the global coordinate frame.

## Localizers

**Select your localizer below and follow the instructions to tune it. Once
your localizer is tuned, come back to this page.**

## Localization Test

*TODO*

Cover:

- How to run `LocalizationTest`
- What `LocalizationTest` should do (what direction driving should
move in, whether moving forward should be positive or negative, etc.)
- If you spin the robot in a circle, it should spin around a point on the
dashboard
- Say "if it's not working go to the troubleshooting page [insert link]"
