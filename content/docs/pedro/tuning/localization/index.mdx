There are many localizers for you to choose from. If you don't have any, you
can use your drive motor encoders.

All localizers except for the OTOS localizer
use a pose exponential method of localization, a way of turning movements
from the robot's coordinate frame to the global coordinate frame.

## Localizers

**Select your localizer below and follow the instructions to tune it. Once
your localizer is tuned, come back to this page.**

## Localization Test

After completing the tuning steps described in your localizer, you can test the accuracy of it.

1. Run the `Tuning` OpMode, then navigate under to `Localization Test`
2. On your computer, connect to your robot's WiFi, and navigate to `http://192.168.43.1:8001/`
3. You should see on panels the robot's position on the field.
4. Observe the movements, make sure moving forward increases `x` and strafing left increases `y`.
