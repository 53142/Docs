Cover:
- Common problems with tuning, and how to fix them
- Where to get help if you're still having trouble

Use the following format:

<Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Bad Localization">
        too bad so sad
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="PID not PIDing">
        skill issue
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot never stops while running Straight Back and Forth or moves the wrong direction">
        **Check if:** 
        - Your localization is inaccurate. Run `LocalizationTest` and check: 
            - when you move the robot forward, does the x-value increase?
            - when you move the robot to the left, does the y-value increase?
            - is the reported heading accurate?
        If not, head over back to the localization section and double check your steps. Ensure that your localization is fully accurate before tuning your PIDs and running automatic tuners. 
        - Your motor directions are reversed. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Robot never moves during Straight Back and Forth">
        **If you are tuning for Translational or Heading PID, this is intentional and there is nothing wrong.**
